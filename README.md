# Get to know comments / feedback about yourself : ANONYMOUSLY !

This project is made using [React JS](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and with [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) on the backend.

## Documentation and preparation

The Idea obviously exists, but the reason for me to do this again is the sort of virality of this sort of a thing in a micro community...
The planning started on a [whimsical flow chart](https://whimsical.com/tellmena-9Azv5ig6NknQXXFzzfvXCC@2Ux7TurymNNUCzLbNs5a)

## Graphql
Graphql was a little bit new , but I had experience with using REST APIs so getting the hang of this was not very difficult. Got a help from teammates at the right times sometimes. 

## Planning and execution

The Project was then managed via an [Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13OTkU43lVPWBaBKaPTLKS4p2KSeQXIDNjc89pfPi4I8/edit?usp=sharing)

## How to use : Flow of events 

The aim of this app is to let users get feedback / comments / gossip about themselves. And fast. 

Flow goes like this : Create Account > Get Link to Share > Share Link on social channels > See Comments which you recieve > CTA of twitter share. 

Thank you all !
